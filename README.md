Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that. So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn, how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? What steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?
1.	How would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave?

Step 1: Gather and Clean data
For starters, we have existing data on when customers have left before including who these customers are and what they have bought. This data is instrumental from where the model will learn from. This is the data we need to prepare by cleaning and labelling data such that we have quality data with the right information we require to create the model.

Step 2: Analyze the cleaned data
Having the required data cleaned, it’s time to analyze the data to identify the pattern or behavior as provided by the existing data. This is achieved by using machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, Torch among other solutions such like from Google, Amazon etc. Here we apply algorithms and tests to this data until we get the desired results.

Step 3: Deploy the model
With a trained model in hand, now we can feed into our systems to predict which customers might leave. If the model is trained right, then it’s in a position to predict correct results.

##clean existing data
We have to ensure we have clean, ordered and necessary data for the problem at hand. The data should also be adequate enough to represent all the possible outcomes. The data should also not be biased and well structure for manipulation.

###create the Algorithm
Here we use the suitable machine learning tools to create the predictive models aligned to the problem we are trying to solve. Depending on the problem at hand, we can create a new model or customize pre-trained models according to our need.

###Train the model
Here we partition the data into two parts, where we use about 80% the existing data to train the models and 20%of the data to assert the predictive capabilities of the model. With training, the model identifies the patterns in the existing data and draws predictions based on these patterns.

####Deploying the model
With a trained model ready, we can now define the scope and the user interface under which to deploy. Here is where the model gets to predict the defined requirements and returns the results outcome.
